            Hey there I'm Guru. I'm a Full-Stack Webdeveloper with a passion for
            all things tech and healthcare. My journey into tech started with a
            Web Development bootcamp at Brainstation where I gained expertise in
            React, MongoDB, Express and Node.js.
            <br /> <br />
            I enjoy meeting new people, reading, writing and discussions on why
            Stannis Baratheon [was] actually the rightful heir to the Iron
            Throne.
